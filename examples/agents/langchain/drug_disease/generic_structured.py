    To answer the question: {original_query}
    Please follow these steps:
    1. Check for entries where display_relation is 'contraindication'.
    2. For the drug in question, check both x_name and y_name columns.
    3. If the drug is found in x_name, look for contraindicated diseases in y_name.
    4. If the drug is found in y_name, look for contraindicated diseases in x_name.
    5. Combine the results from steps 3 and 4.
    6. Compare the found contraindicated diseases with the options provided in the question.
    7. Based on the combined results and comparison, answer the original question.
    Provide a step-by-step explanation of your process and findings.
