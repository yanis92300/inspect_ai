        To answer the question: {original_query}
        Please follow these steps:
        1. Check for entries where display_relation is 'synergistic interaction'.
        2. For the drug in question, check both x_name and y_name columns.
        3. If the drug is found in x_name, look for interaction drugs in y_name.
        4. If the drug is found in y_name, look for interaction drugs in x_name.
        5. Combine the results from steps 3 and 4.
        6. Based on the combined results, answer the original question.
        Provide a step-by-step explanation of your process and findings.
